<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h1>

<p>My background is in quant finance, mostly writing C++, Python, and (shudder) Matlab. Over the last few months I've
been learning Haskell, so as an excuse to learn some more Haskell, I decided to try to solve a fundamental
quantitative finance problem in Haskell. Quant finance tends to love <a href="http://quantlib.org/index.shtml">tangled OOP</a>, so I figured a functional programming style might be a new twist on the problem.</p>

<p>I was trying to think of a good problem to start with, and I came up with the idea of a simple (but powerful) Monte
Carlo engine for Haskell. With that in mind, I started to think about architecture. I'm going to write this up in
a few posts, but my rough plan is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Today's post: specification of contingent claims</li>
<li>Implementation of the Monte Carlo engine and underlying models</li>
<li>Odds and ends (implementation of simple yield curves, volatility surfaces, etc) and future plans</li>
</ul>

<p>The target audience for this blog post is folks who know a bit of Haskell and are curious how it might apply to this particular problem.</p>

<h1>
<a id="quick-sidebar-quant-finance-basics" class="anchor" href="#quick-sidebar-quant-finance-basics" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quick Sidebar: Quant Finance Basics</h1>

<p>If you know even a little bit about quant finance, you can skip this. For the rest of you, a few quick pointers:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A contingent claim is just a payout of cash that is dependent on something happening. The simplest contingent
claim is a binary option. A binary option pays a fixed amount of cash immediately if some underlying (usually a
stock) is above or below a certain amount. For instance, a binary call on XYZ stock with a fixed payout of $10 and
a "strike price" of $50 will pay $10 if XYZ is above $50 at the option's expiration.</p></li>
<li><p>A Monte Carlo engine uses an underlying model to evolve values. Models specify a way of creating a growth rate
and an idea of how the value will move (in some cases including a distribution). For instance, the most basic
model (Black-Scholes), assumes that its values grow at a fixed interest rate and that they will follow a lognormal distribution. Models get very byzantine in some cases.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>
<a id="the-contingentclaim-type" class="anchor" href="#the-contingentclaim-type" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The ContingentClaim Type</h1>

<p>The first thing any Monte Carlo engine needs is a way to specify your payoffs. The great Simon Peyton-Jones
himself has worked on <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/Papers/financial-%0Acontracts/contracts-icfp.htm">this very problem</a>. His solution is, of course, quite good, but it's actually too general for our
purposes. There are many types of contracts that can be expressed in his system that cannot be easily priced in a
Monte Carlo framework.</p>

<p>With that in mind, let's think about what a contingent claim really is, specifically from the standpoint of what a
Monte Carlo engine needs to know about it.  </p>

<ol>
<li> The MC engine needs to know what to look at. Is the option on Apple's stock or Microsoft's stock? Or maybe
the ten-year treasury rate? For my purposes, I'll refer to the value being looked at as the "observable".</li>
<li> The engine will need to know how to combine the different observations to turn them into a cash flow.</li>
<li> The engine will need to know when to stop evolving and check the value of the observable.</li>
</ol>

<p>The third of these is pretty easy to represent. For this one, we'll just create a list of times when the model
needs to stop and check an observable. Easy enough.</p>

<p>Now for 1 and 2, let's make this a little simpler. What if every time we stop the model, we simply put a structure
containing all of the observables into a Map, keyed off of a Time? Then we can finish specifying our contingent claim with a function with this type:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-haskell"><pre><span class="pl-c1">Map</span> <span class="pl-c1">Time</span> <span class="pl-c1">Observables</span> -&gt; <span class="pl-c1">CashFlow</span></pre></div>

<p>Where a CashFlow is just:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-haskell"><pre><span class="pl-k">data</span> <span class="pl-c1">CashFlow</span> = <span class="pl-c1">CashFlow</span> { cfTime :: <span class="pl-c1">Time</span> , cfAmount :: <span class="pl-c1">Double</span> }</pre></div>

<p>For now let's just imagine Observables is just a list of Doubles. In practice we're doing something better than that (see the bottom of this post for some details), but let's keep it simple for now.</p>

<p>After some iterations on the design, I came up with the following types to represent contingent claims.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-haskell"><pre><span class="pl-k">data</span> <span class="pl-c1">CCProcessor</span> = <span class="pl-c1">CCProcessor</span> { 
    <span class="pl-en">monitorTime</span> <span class="pl-k">::</span> <span class="pl-k">Time</span> 
  , payoutFunc  :: [<span class="pl-c1">Map</span> <span class="pl-c1">Time</span> <span class="pl-c1">Observables</span> -&gt; <span class="pl-c1">CashFlow</span>]
}
<span class="pl-k">newtype</span> <span class="pl-c1">ContingentClaim</span> = <span class="pl-c1">ContingentClaim</span> { unCC :: [<span class="pl-c1">CCProcessor</span>] }</pre></div>

<p>If you can think about this from the standpoint of the Monte Carlo engine, the engine can tick through each element
of the list. At each element it will evolve the simulation through until the given Time and put the Observables
into a running Map. Once this is done it will run any payoutFunc that is available (or maybe multiple ones) and determine the cash flows that need to be processed.</p>

<a id="monoid-to-the-rescue" class="anchor" href="#monoid-to-the-rescue" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Monoid to the Rescue</h1>

<p>One nifty thing about this is that it's easy to put together a bunch of different contingent claims simply by interleaving them based on the Time field.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-haskell"><pre><span class="pl-c">-- | Combines two contingent claims into one. </span>
<span class="pl-en">combine</span> <span class="pl-k">::</span> <span class="pl-k">ContingentClaim</span> <span class="pl-smi">a</span> <span class="pl-k">-&gt;</span> <span class="pl-k">ContingentClaim</span> <span class="pl-smi">a</span> <span class="pl-k">-&gt;</span> <span class="pl-k">ContingentClaim</span> <span class="pl-smi">a</span>
combine (<span class="pl-c1">ContingentClaim</span> x) (<span class="pl-c1">ContingentClaim</span> y) = <span class="pl-c1">ContingentClaim</span> $ combine' x y
  <span class="pl-k">where</span>
    combine' (cc1:ccs1) (cc2:ccs2)
      | monitorTime cc1 == monitorTime cc2 = <span class="pl-k">let</span>
            <span class="pl-c1">CCProcessor</span> t mf  = cc1
            <span class="pl-c1">CCProcessor</span> _ mf' = cc2 <span class="pl-k">in</span>
          <span class="pl-c1">CCProcessor</span> t (mf++mf') : combine' ccs1 ccs2
      | monitorTime cc1 &gt; monitorTime cc2 = cc2 : combine' (cc1:ccs1) ccs2
      | <span class="pl-c1">otherwise</span> = cc1 : combine' ccs1 (cc2:ccs2)
    combine' cs1 cs2 = cs1 ++ cs2</pre></div>

<p>But wait a sec, this is neat:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-haskell"><pre><span class="pl-k">instance</span> <span class="pl-k">Monoid</span> <span class="pl-k">ContingentClaim</span> <span class="pl-k">where</span> 
  mempty = <span class="pl-c1">ContingentClaim</span> <span class="pl-c1">[]</span> 
  mappend = combine</pre></div>

<p>So now I can very easily compose a bunch of different options together. That seems handy.</p>

<h1>
<a id="monads-enter-the-picture" class="anchor" href="#monads-enter-the-picture" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Monads Enter the Picture</h1>

<p>Now let's think about what a few simple options would look like in this framework.  A binary call option with a payout of 50 with a strike of 100 on the 0th observable, paying out at time 1, would look like this:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-haskell"><pre>binCall = <span class="pl-c1">ContingentClaim</span> [<span class="pl-c1">1.0</span>, [\m -&gt; <span class="pl-k">if</span> m ! <span class="pl-c1">1.0</span> !! <span class="pl-c1">0</span> &gt; <span class="pl-c1">100</span> <span class="pl-k">then</span> <span class="pl-c1">50</span> <span class="pl-k">else</span> <span class="pl-c1">0</span><span class="pl-k">]]</span></pre></div>

<p>Okay, that's a bit ugly. Now imagine if I want a payout that averages the observable's price over ten different
times? Trust me, I've tried, it isn't pretty.</p>

<p>So what we need is a way to build up a ContingentClaim in a nice composable way. Now the answer to every
question in Haskell is "Make a monad!", and this is no different. So what I did was combined two monads, the
Reader and Writer monad. The Reader monad (which is really just the function monad) allows me to build up my
payout function in a pretty nice and composable way. Meanwhile the Writer monad keeps track of the times I'm
checking the observable.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-haskell"><pre><span class="pl-k">type</span> <span class="pl-c1">CCBuilder</span> w r a = <span class="pl-c1">WriterT</span> w (<span class="pl-c1">Reader</span> r) a</pre></div>

<p>We'll also need something to pull our completed ContingentClaim out of the monad. The details of the implementation are beyond the scope of this (and tedious anyway), so just make note of the type:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-haskell"><pre><span class="pl-en">specify</span> <span class="pl-k">::</span> <span class="pl-k">CCBuilder</span> <span class="pl-k">ContingentClaim</span> (<span class="pl-k">Map</span> <span class="pl-k">Time</span> <span class="pl-k">Observables</span>) <span class="pl-k">CashFlow</span> 
        -&gt; <span class="pl-c1">ContingentClaim</span></pre></div>

<p>Now let's make a function that checks an observable's value at a certain time. We'll call it monitor, and it'll check the 0th observable.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-haskell"><pre><span class="pl-en">monitor</span> <span class="pl-k">::</span> <span class="pl-k">Time</span> <span class="pl-k">-&gt;</span> <span class="pl-k">CCBuilder</span> <span class="pl-k">ContingentClaim</span> (<span class="pl-k">Map</span> <span class="pl-k">Observables</span> <span class="pl-c1">Double</span>) <span class="pl-c1">Double</span> 
monitor t = <span class="pl-k">do</span> 
  tell $ <span class="pl-c1">ContingentClaim</span> [<span class="pl-c1">CCProcessor</span> t <span class="pl-c1">[]</span>] <span class="pl-c">--adds to the list of Times</span>
  m &lt;- ask  <span class="pl-c">--grabs the Map of values</span>
  <span class="pl-c1">return</span> $ (m ! t) !! <span class="pl-c1">0</span> <span class="pl-c">--Yes, I know how ugly this is.</span></pre></div>

<p>The details of the Reader and Writer monad are beyond the scope of this post, but suffice it to say that this adds to the running total of times to check the observable (tell), and while getting the value out of the map to use in the Reader monad.</p>

<p>Now we have all we need to build composable contingent claims. A few examples:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-haskell"><pre>
binCall strike t payout = specify $ <span class="pl-k">do</span> 
  x &lt;- monitor t 
  <span class="pl-k">let</span> amt = <span class="pl-k">if</span> x &gt; strike <span class="pl-k">then</span> payout <span class="pl-k">else</span> <span class="pl-c1">0</span> 
  <span class="pl-c1">return</span> (<span class="pl-c1">CashFlow</span> t amt)

vanillaCall strike t = specify $ <span class="pl-k">do</span> 
  x &lt;- monitor t 
  <span class="pl-k">let</span> amt = <span class="pl-c1">max</span> (x - strike) <span class="pl-c1">0</span> 
  <span class="pl-c1">return</span> (<span class="pl-c1">CashFlow</span> t amt)

<span class="pl-c">--Calculates the average price on a series of times. </span>
averagePrice priceTimes t = specify $ 
  <span class="pl-k">do</span> x &lt;- <span class="pl-c1">mapM</span> monitor priceTimes 
  <span class="pl-k">let</span> val = <span class="pl-c1">sum</span> x / <span class="pl-c1">fromIntegral</span> (<span class="pl-c1">length</span> x) 
  <span class="pl-c1">return</span> $ <span class="pl-c1">CashFlow</span> t val

<span class="pl-c">--We can even do insane things </span>
bizarre = specify $ <span class="pl-k">do</span>
  x &lt;- monitor <span class="pl-c1">0.5</span> 
  y &lt;- monitor <span class="pl-c1">1.0</span> 
  z &lt;- monitor <span class="pl-c1">2.0</span> 
  <span class="pl-k">let</span> t = <span class="pl-k">if</span> <span class="pl-c1">sin</span> x &gt; <span class="pl-c1">0</span> <span class="pl-k">then</span> <span class="pl-c1">7.0</span> <span class="pl-k">else</span> <span class="pl-c1">2.0</span> <span class="pl-c">--why would we do this??? </span>
  <span class="pl-c1">return</span> $ <span class="pl-c1">CashFlow</span> t (<span class="pl-c1">cos</span> (y + z))

<span class="pl-c">--let's put a binary option together with a vanilla option! </span>
portfolio = binCall <span class="pl-c1">100</span> <span class="pl-c1">1</span> <span class="pl-c1">50</span> &lt;&gt; vanillaCall <span class="pl-c1">100</span> <span class="pl-c1">1</span></pre></div>

<p>Additionally the library contains some helpful functions like multiplier, which scales up a ContingentClaim payout by a constant factor. And of course I can make a function <code>short = multiplier (-1)</code>. So a call spread could look like this:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-haskell"><pre>callSpread lowStrike highStrike t = vanillaCall lowStrike t &lt;&gt; short (vanillaCall highStrike t)</pre></div>

<p>Neat!</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier that the Observables type is a bit more sophisticated than I was letting on. The issue is that
right now I can do this:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-haskell"><pre>unsafeMonitor t = <span class="pl-k">do</span> 
  m &lt;- ask 
  <span class="pl-c1">return</span> (m ! t !! <span class="pl-c1">3</span>)</pre></div>

<p>But what if 3 is out of bounds? With that in mind, I created types that represent fixed length vectors. For instance:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-haskell"><pre><span class="pl-c">--I'm leaving out the UNPACK pragma and strictness annotations, </span>
<span class="pl-c">--but you get the idea. </span>
<span class="pl-k">data</span> <span class="pl-c1">Observables1</span> = <span class="pl-c1">Observables1</span> <span class="pl-c1">Double</span> 
<span class="pl-k">data</span> <span class="pl-c1">Observables2</span> = <span class="pl-c1">Observables2</span> <span class="pl-c1">Double</span> <span class="pl-c1">Double</span> 
<span class="pl-c">-- ...</span>

<span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-e">Obs1</span> <span class="pl-smi">a</span> <span class="pl-k">where</span> 
  <span class="pl-en">obs1</span> <span class="pl-k">::</span> <span class="pl-smi">a</span> <span class="pl-k">-&gt;</span> <span class="pl-c1">Double</span>
<span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-e">Obs2</span> <span class="pl-smi">a</span> <span class="pl-k">where</span> 
  <span class="pl-en">obs2</span> <span class="pl-k">::</span> <span class="pl-smi">a</span> <span class="pl-k">-&gt;</span> <span class="pl-c1">Double</span>

<span class="pl-k">instance</span> <span class="pl-k">Obs1</span> <span class="pl-k">Observables1</span> <span class="pl-k">where</span> 
  obs1 (<span class="pl-c1">Observables1</span> x) = x
<span class="pl-k">instance</span> <span class="pl-k">Obs1</span> <span class="pl-k">Observables2</span> <span class="pl-k">where</span> 
  obs1 (<span class="pl-c1">Observables2</span> x _) = x
<span class="pl-k">instance</span> <span class="pl-k">Obs2</span> <span class="pl-k">Observables2</span> <span class="pl-k">where</span> 
  obs2 (<span class="pl-c1">Observables2</span> _ x) = x
<span class="pl-c">-- ...</span></pre></div>

<p>Enough of that, you get the idea. Now a quick rewrite of the unsafeMonitor function:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-haskell"><pre>monitor t = <span class="pl-k">do</span>
  tell $ <span class="pl-c1">ContingentClaim</span> [<span class="pl-c1">CCProcessor</span> t <span class="pl-c1">[]</span>]
  m &lt;- ask 
  <span class="pl-c1">return</span> (obs4 $ m ! t)</pre></div>

<p>One last change:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-haskell"><pre><span class="pl-k">data</span> <span class="pl-c1">CCProcessor</span> a = <span class="pl-c1">CCProcessor</span>  {
    <span class="pl-en">monitorTime</span>      <span class="pl-k">::</span> <span class="pl-k">Time</span>
  , payoutFunc       :: [<span class="pl-c1">M</span>.<span class="pl-c1">Map</span> <span class="pl-c1">Time</span> a -&gt; <span class="pl-c1">CashFlow</span>]
}

<span class="pl-k">newtype</span> <span class="pl-c1">ContingentClaim</span> a = <span class="pl-c1">ContingentClaim</span> { unCC :: [<span class="pl-c1">CCProcessor</span> a] }

<span class="pl-c">--we'll need RankNTypes</span>

<span class="pl-c">--contingent claims with one observable.</span>
<span class="pl-k">type</span> <span class="pl-c1">ContingentClaim1</span> = forall a . <span class="pl-c1">Obs1</span> a =&gt; <span class="pl-c1">ContingentClaim</span> a
<span class="pl-c">--contingent claims with two observables.</span>
<span class="pl-k">type</span> <span class="pl-c1">ContingentClaim2</span> = forall a . <span class="pl-c1">Obs2</span> a =&gt; <span class="pl-c1">ContingentClaim</span> a
<span class="pl-c">-- ...</span></pre></div>

<p>And the type checker will now ensure that you're not accessing something that isn't being modeled. More on this
when we get into the model implementation details.</p>

<a id="conclusion" class="anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h1>

<p>You almost certainly haven't had as much fun reading this as I had writing the library. Haskell completely changes
the way you solve problems, and while the abstractions are unfamiliar at first, they're remarkably powerful. It's
still very much pre-pre-alpha but under heavy development.</p>

<p>In the mean time, check out the package on <a href="https://github.com/boundedvariation/quantfin">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/quantfin-0.2.0.0">Hackage</a>.</p>

<p>Next time we'll cover a little bit about how we put together the engine itself and implemented models.</p>
